This app, Notebox, allows you to login and post notes in a local environment.  
The main page streams existing time-stamped notes and has a form at the top for posting new notes.
Functionalities include: deleting notes, viewing notes in a magnified state, and adding postscripts to notes.
Users are identified by username and password. They can be added or changed in models.py.
Notebox runs on localhost:8000 and requires Python and Flask to work.
To run Notebox, type "python notebox.py" in the command line.
